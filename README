Elemental
=========

Elemental is a high-level high-performance framework for distributed-memory 
dense linear algebra that is inspired by [PLAPACK][1] and, more recently, 
[FLAME][2].

Build
=====
There is now a CMake [http://www.cmake.org] build script which supports building
with and without PMRRR and attempts to search for the appropriate BLAS/LAPACK 
configurations. The four build-modes are:
- HybridDebug
- HybridRelease
- PureDebug
- PureRelease
Each should be built within its own separate build directory. For instance, 
to build the pure-MPI release:
      cd elemental
      mkdir -p build/PureRelease
      cd build/PureRelease
      cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=PureRelease \
            -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/mpi/cxx/compiler \
            -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/mpi/c/compiler \
            -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=/path/to/serial/fortran/compiler \
            ../..
      make
If the correct BLAS/LAPACK libraries are not found, try specifying them using
by appending the additional cmake flags of the form:
  -DMATH_LIBS="-L/path/to/first/lib -lfirst_lib etc."
where the math libs should be optimized for single core usage for pure-MPI 
builds and threaded for the hybrid builds.

On BlueGene/P, one should instead run (after loading the dec2010 compiler)
      cd elemental
      mkdir -p build/PureRelease
      cd build/PureRelease
      cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=PureRelease \
            -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../cmake/toolchains/BGP-xl_dec2010-essl_4.3.1-1.cmake \
            ../..
      make

On Ranger, one can similarly pick from the toolchain files:
      cmake/toolchains/Ranger-gcc_4.4-mvapich_1.0.1-mkl_10.0.1.014.cmake
      cmake/toolchains/Ranger-gcc_4.4-mvapich2_1.2-mkl_10.0.1.014.cmake
      cmake/toolchains/Ranger-intel_10.1-mvapich_1.0.1-mkl_10.0.1.014.cmake
      cmake/toolchains/Ranger-intel_10.1-mvapich2_1.2-mkl_10.0.1.014.cmake

The CMake build system is still new, so please email jack.poulson@gmail.com with
any build problems or comments.

Tuning
======
There are a few categories of parameters that can be tuned for better 
performance:

- The algorithmic blocksize can be adjusted at any time with the function 

  void elemental::SetBlocksize( int blocksize );

- The process grid dimensions should typically be square, but they can be 
  manually chosen to build an r x c grid using the extended process grid 
  constructor:

  elemental::Grid::Grid( MPI_Comm comm, int r, int c );

- The Householder tridiagonalization approach may be chosen using the routine:

    void elemental::lapack::internal::SetTridiagApproach
    ( elemental::lapack::internal::TridiagApproach approach );

  The choices are:
    elemental::lapack::internal::TRIDIAG_NORMAL
    elemental::lapack::internal::TRIDIAG_SQUARE
    elemental::lapack::internal::TRIDIAG_DEFAULT
  The first always uses the general nonsquare grid algorithm, even when
  running on a square grid. The second drops down to the largest perfect square
  number of processors less than or equal to the number available in order to
  lower communication costs. However, in order to do so, we must choose how to
  order the perfect square number of processes into a grid, and the choice is
  often important for performance. One can choose between row-major and 
  column-major ordering via the routine

    void elemental::lapack::internal::SetTridiagSquareGridOrder
    ( elemental::lapack::internal::GridOrder order );

  The choices are:
    elemental::lapack::internal::COL_MAJOR
    elemental::lapack::internal::ROW_MAJOR
  Finally, the default option uses the square grid algorithm if the input matrix
  is already distributed over a square grid, otherwise, the normal nonsquare 
  grid algorithm is used.

- The local blocksizes for Hemv and Symv may be set for single-precision, 
  double-precision, single-precision complex, and double-precision complex 
  using:

  void elemental::blas::SetLocalHemvBlocksize<T>( int blocksize ); 
  void elemental::blas::SetLocalSymvBlocksize<T>( int blocksize ); 

  These interfaces were exposed because they play an important role in the 
  speed of the parallel Householder tridiagonalization routine, 
  elemental::lapack::Tridiag on non-square process grids.

- The local blocksizes for local triangular rank-k and rank-2k updates may be 
  set using:

  void elemental::blas::SetLocalTriangularRankKBlocksize<T>( int blocksize );
  void elemental::blas::SetLocalTriangularRank2KBlocksize<T>( int blocksize );

  These blocksizes are not nearly as important, but they do effect the 
  performance of parallel Syrk/Herk, Syr2k/Her2k, and Cholesky. The generalized
  Hermitian eigensolvers do perform a Cholesky factorization, but it is only a 
  small part of the overall runtime.
