<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Elemental is a library for distributed-memory dense linear algebra that
is essentially a careful combination of the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A <a class="reference external" href="http://cs.utexas.edu/users/plapack">PLAPACK</a>-like framework of matrix
distributions that are trivial for users to redistribute between.</li>
<li>A <a class="reference external" href="http://cs.utexas.edu/users/flame">FLAME</a> approach to tracking
submatrices within (blocked) algorithms.</li>
<li>Element-wise distribution of matrices. One of the major benefits to this
approach is the much more convenient handling of submatrices, relative to
block distribution schemes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like <a class="reference external" href="http://netlib.org/scalapack">ScaLAPACK</a> and PLAPACK, Elemental&#8217;s
primary goal is in extending <a class="reference external" href="http://netlib.org/blas">BLAS</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://netlib.org/lapack">LAPACK</a>-like functionality into distributed-memory
environments.</p>
<p>Though Elemental already contains high-quality implementations of a large
portion of BLAS and LAPACK-like routines, there are a few important reasons
why ScaLAPACK or PLAPACK might be more appropriate:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Elemental does not yet support non-Hermitian eigenvalue problems, but
ScaLAPACK does.</li>
<li>Elemental does not yet provide routines for narrowly banded linear systems,
though ScaLAPACK does.</li>
<li>Some applications exploit the block distribution format used by PLAPACK
and ScaLAPACK in order to increase the efficiency of matrix
construction. Though it is clearly possible to redistribute the matrix into
an element-wise distribution format after construction, this might add
an unnecessary level of complexity.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>At this point, the vast majority of Elemental&#8217;s source code is in header
files, so do not be surprised by the sparsity of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/</span></tt> folder; please
also look in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">include/</span></tt>. There were essentially two reasons for moving as
much of Elemental as possible into header files:</p>
<ol class="last arabic simple">
<li>In practice, most executables only require a small subset of the library,
so avoiding the overhead of compiling the entire library beforehand can be
significant. On the other hand, if one naively builds many such
executables with overlapping functionality, then the mainly-header
approach becomes slower.</li>
<li>Though Elemental does not yet fully support computation over arbitrary
fields, the vast majority of its pieces do. Moving templated
implementations into header files is a necessary step in the process and
also allowed for certain templating techniques to exploited in order to
simplify the class hierarchy.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="section" id="dependencies">
<h2>Dependencies<a class="headerlink" href="#dependencies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Functioning C++03 and ANSI C compilers.</li>
<li>A working MPI implementation.</li>
<li>BLAS and LAPACK (ideally version 3.3 or greater) implementations. If
a sufficiently up-to-date LAPACK implementation is not provided, then
a working F90 compiler is required in order to build Elemental&#8217;s eigensolvers
(the tridiagonal eigensolver, <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/pmrrr">PMRRR</a>,
requires recent LAPACK routines).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> (version 2.8.5 or later).</li>
</ul>
<p>Elemental should successfully build on nearly every platform, as it has been
verified to build on most major desktop platforms (including Linux, Mac OS X,
Microsoft Windows, and Cygwin), as well as a wide variety of Linux clusters (including Blue Gene/P).</p>

<p>There are two important exceptions in the main library:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AxpyInterface</span></tt> for building distributed matrices is based upon

<ul class="simple">
<li>The parallel tridiagonal eigensolver, PMRRR, is written by Matthias Petschow
